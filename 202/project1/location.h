/**
 * @file location.h
 * @brief Header file for class and method definitions of Location and City classes.
 *
 * `City` is the data member of the nodes in the linked-list. The `City` class maintains
 * information pertaining to the state of the city. That is, which city it is and whether its on fire.
 *
 * The `Location` class maintains information about the - you guessed it - the location.
 * That is, the population, the land area, and the type of area it's in. All these values are initialized
 * randomly using the `generate_random(...)` function in `utils.cpp`.
