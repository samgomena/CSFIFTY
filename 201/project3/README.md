#### Loop unrolling questions


> What version of the code provided the best performance? (non-optimized, unrolled 4 times, or unrolled 8 times)
    
- Typically it was the h44 that had the best performance. Although it wasn't assigned I made a hw46 that was unrolled 6 times and that had far superior performance.

> Did loop unrolling provided any benefit?

- It was a little bit faster. 

> Why do you think that loop unrolling was or was not beneficial in this case?

- I think it was beneficial because in some instances it was faster. But moreover, it was easy to implement. Looking at Amdahl's law for intuition.
